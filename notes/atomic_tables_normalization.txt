Atomic Tables and Table Normalization 

- every table should focus on describing exactly one thing
- then ask what do you need to describe the things inside your TABLE
- if any of the attributes need multiple values, break them up
    or discard them
- avoid multiple columns with the same information
- do not include multiple values in one cell
- this is called normalizing the table
